                Is “a ban on offensive autonomous weapons beyond meaningful human control” going to work?

                Letter to the Editor:</p>
<p>
In response to the recent letter penned by the world’s most prominent researchers, it is highly unlikely that their call for a ban on the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) within the military would be effective at all. </p>
<p>For one, there is a clear advantage for militaries to utilize intelligence. The usage of AI could prevent civilian casualties with more precise targeting; imagine a drone utilizing machine learning that could successfully distinguish a farmer with a rake from a rifle at long range. Even farther down the line, sending robots into warfare would also save the lives of soldiers by keeping them out of the battlefield all together. For countries with large military budgets, the design and manufacturing cost of creating AI and corresponding robots is negligible compared to the high value we hold for human life. Even knowing the potential downsides of implementing AI weaponry, in wartime, countries will almost always pay whatever the cost to decrease their casualties and gain an upper hand.</p>
<p>
AI is considered the third era of warfare, after gunpowder and nuclear weapons. Numerous bans have attempted to be placed on nuclear weapons between countries across the world, yet time and time again they are broken. Countries have done whatever is necessary, regardless of legality, in the past to protect and strengthen themselves. Since 2016, Iran has broken their nuclear agreements three times.. Why would we expect artificially intelligent weaponry agreements to be any different?</p>
<p>
The last reason the ban will not work is simple game theory. AI will provide an overwhelming advantage to any military that holds it. The risk that an enemy could develop AI in secret and deploy it at will during wartime is extremely high, and the cost if this happened would be devastating. This is a risk that most countries are not willing to take. Below is the basic game theory decision matrix:
</p>

<p class="text-center">
      The Nash equilibrium is (AI, AI)
</p></div>
<p>
For all of the above concerns we do not believe that banning such weapons through agreements would be effective.
