**Lab 1**

*Objective*: The objective of this lab was to gain familiarity with the Arduino UNO microcontroller and its IDE. 

*Lab Procedure*

We first opened the Arduino IDE and clicked under Files/Examples/01.Basic/Blink. In order to make sure the Arduino UNO was properly connected to the IDE, we clicked under Tools/Board/ and selected Arduino/Genuino UNO. We also verified that the IDE is connected to the right port by looking under Tools/Port. It should be as in the following images:
